I have tried to combine Pm2 in my workflow and realized that it is a replacement for nodemon, what I'll regularly use, as my development tool to track my changes.
### The main differences:
- Pm2 keeps your app 24/7.
- It has a load balancer that lets you see which procces are up/stopped or returned errors.
- It maintains different proccess and has a smooth system to choose the process we want and the actions we want to do to this process.
